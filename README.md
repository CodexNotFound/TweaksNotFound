# TweaksNotFound
Inspired by a comment a member of the Zedcraft community jokingly made, I've created this mod in order to keep chat readable while people were constantly dying in minigames. Currently TweaksNotFound has a focus on small tweaks to the chat, though other small tweaks to the client are an option for the future.

## Goals
The main goals for this mod are:
 - Minor tweaks to how existing information is shown to the player
 - All tweaks should have an option to disable it

## FAQ
**Can you make a Forge version?**  
I probably could, but this mod was made mainly for myself and a few friends. I won't be making a Forge port myself, but feel free to make a port yourself.

**Can you update it to Minecraft version _x_?**  
I can, and I will when I'm in need for it. I'm open to Pull Requests for support for different versions. 

**Can you implement feature _y_?**  
If the feature can be implemented according to the goals for this mod, please open an issue with the suggestion (one suggestion per issue)

**This mod doesn't work in combination with mod _z_, can you make it work?**  
I can do my best, but it won't be my top priority unless I run into it myself. Please open an issue with the version of this mod and the other mod that don't work together. I'll pick it up when I've got time or somebody else might pick it up.
